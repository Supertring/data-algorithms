# Stack:
* Linear data structure, that follows the principle of __Last In First Out (LIFO)__.
* Basic Operations:
  * Push: Add an element to the top of stack
  * Pop: Remove an element from the top of stack
  * IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty
  * IsFull: Check if the stack is full
  * Peek: Get the element from top of the stack without removing it.

## Stack Time Complexity
* The basic stack operation have a time complexity of $O(1)$, when implemented using array.
* Because the operations involve directly accessing or modifying the top element of the stack.
* There is no need to traverse the entire data structure.

## Application of Stack
* __To reverse a word__
* __In compilers__: used to calculate the value of expressions e.g.: 2+4/5*(5-2).
* __In browsers__: WEb pages visited in browser can be set on stack. The back and forward functionality in a browser is implement with stack.
